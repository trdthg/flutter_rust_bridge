#: src/index.md:16
msgid ""
"* **Memory-safe**: Never need to think about malloc/free.\n"
"* **Feature-rich**: `enum`s with values, platform-optimized `Vec`, possibly "
"recursive `struct`, zero-copy big arrays, opaque types on arbitrary "
"structs/classes, `Stream` (iterator) abstraction, error (`Result`) handling, "
"cancellable tasks, concurrency control, and more. See full features "
"[here](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/feature.html).\n"
"* **Async programming**: Rust code will never block the Flutter. Call Rust "
"naturally from Flutter's main isolate (thread); sync mode also equally "
"supported.\n"
"* **Lightweight**: This is not a huge framework that includes everything, so "
"you are free to use your favorite Flutter and Rust libraries. <sub>For "
"example, state-management with Flutter library (e.g. MobX) can be elegant "
"and simple (contrary to implementing in Rust); implementing a photo "
"manipulation algorithm in Rust will be fast and safe (countrary to "
"implementing in Flutter).</sub>\n"
"* **Cross-platform**: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Web.\n"
"* **Easy to code-review & convince yourself**: This package simply simulates "
"how humans  write boilerplate code. If you want to convince yourself (or "
"your team) that it is safe, there is not much code to look at. No magic at "
"all! ([More "
"about](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/safety.html) safety "
"concerns.)\n"
"* **Fast**: It is only a thin (though feature-rich) wrapper, without "
"overhead such as protobuf serialization, thus performant. (More "
"[benchmarks](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/issues/318#issuecomment-1034536815) "
"later) <small>(Throw away components like thread-pool to make it even "
"faster)</small>\n"
"* **Pure-Dart compatible:** Despite the name, this package is 100% "
"compatible with "
"[pure](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/blob/master/frb_example/pure_dart/README.md) "
"Dart."

msgstr ""

#: src/library/platform_setup.md:48
msgid ""
"1. We have a series of build scripts (`/scripts/build-*.sh`) that build all "

"2. These binaries are uploaded to somewhere online; as mentioned previously, "
"we will use\n"
"GitHub releases in this guide (which is [automated in ci](ci.md)).\n"
"3. When the Dart tooling builds our library (such as when an application "
"consuming\n"
"our library is built), it invokes the platform specific build process.\n"
"We hijack this build process by downloading a copy of the binaries for the "
"needed platform,\n"
"*if not already present on the filesystem*. This last part is the key; it "
"allows us to run\n"
"integration tests locally and in CI by providing our own copy of the "
"binaries instead of\n"
"forcing our build process to always fetch the binaries from GitHub "
"releases.\n"
"4. After the binaries are stored locally (either by being copied to the "
"proper folder(s)\n"
"or by fetching them from online), we extract them and place them in the "
"needed locations."

"Here are the relevant directories per platform.\n"

"`library_tag` below with\n"
"`library_name-vVERSION` where `VERSION` is the current version in your "
"Dart-only `pubspec.yaml`.\n"
"This setup is a bit of a pain to test locally with but I am not sure there "
"is a better way at the moment\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "Let us see what happens when a function is called."
msgstr ""

#: src/contributing/design.md:56
msgid ""
"Suppose a user calls a (generated) Dart function `func({required String "
"str})`. Then, the following happens:"
msgstr ""

#: src/contributing/design.md:58
msgid ""
"1. The generated Dart function, `func({required String str})`, convert "
"\"_Dart api data_\" (i.e. the data that user really provides) into \"_Dart "
"wire data_\" (i.e. the data that will really pass between Dart and Rust). "
"More specifically, it calls `_api2wire_String(str)` and get a "
"`ffi.Pointer<wire_uint_8_list>` (because `String`s use `pub struct "
"wire_uint_8_list { ptr: *mut u8, len: i32 }` under the hood).\n"
"2. Now we call the Dart version of `wire_func`, with low-level data like "
"`wire_uint_8_list`. We have used our codegen to create a Rust `wire_func` "
"function, and use `cbindgen` to generate the corresponding C function, and "
"use `ffigen` to get the corresponding Dart function. Here, we call the Dart "
"version of `wire_func`. Since Dart FFI and Rust FFI is C-compatible, it "
"seamlessly calls the Rust version of `wire_func`. Notice that, since we are "
"utilizing C-compatible functions (and it is the only feasible way), we can "
"only pass around low-level things like pointers, instead of high-level and "
"safe things.\n"
"3. Surely, the Rust `wire_func` is called. The function uses `.wire2api()` "
"to convert \"_Rust wire data_\" (`wire_uint_8_list` here) into \"_Rust api "
"data_\" (`String` here, i.e. data that users really use).\n"
"4. The `FLUTTER_RUST_BRIDGE_HANDLER` is called with \"_Rust api data_\". "
"That handler is user-customizable, so users may provide their own "
"implementation other than the default thread-pool, etc. By default, we use a "
"thread pool, and we call the user-written `func` Rust function in `api.rs`.\n"
"5. The user-written `fn func(str: String) -> String { ... }` is called, and "
"we get a return value.\n"
"6. The return value, a `String`, is posted to the Dart side. It is done by "
"the Dart-provided API, "
"[`Dart_PostCObject`](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/fd0d3b254690007d0ebc84175f30fa7d7491ec3e/runtime/include/dart_native_api.h#L124), "
"which let us provide C structs and it will automatically become Dart data on "
"the other side. We use the Rust-safe wrapper `allo-isolate` for it. We "
"deliberately choose this, because this enables Dart code to be _async_ "
"instead of sync.\n"
"7. On the Dart side, we now see some Dart objects (indeed \"_Dart wire "
"data_\"). We use functions like `_wire2api_SomeType` to convert it to the "
"final \"_Dart api data_\". Notice this \"wire2api\" is on _Dart_ side, so it "
"means \"_Dart_ wire data to _Dart_ api data\", and is different from the one "
"above which is for Rust. For example, since `Dart_PostCObject` does not "
"provide a way to construct arbitrary structs(classes), we have to pass Rust "
"structs as lists, and use the `wire2api` to convert them to corresponding "
"Dart classes.\n"
"8. The final result value is provided as return value of the Dart function, "
"`func`, that the user called just now. A function call finishes!"
